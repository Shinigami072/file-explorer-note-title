# Obsidian File Explorer Note Titles

Shows note's title instead of just a filename in file-explorer.

The title is resolved as:
- title field in frontmatter
- first alias in frontmatter
- first header in the note.
It's possible to turn of any of those sources in Settings

Also replaces the titles in the graphview with the note's title.
